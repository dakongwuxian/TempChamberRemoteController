# TempChamberRemoteController
This is a GUI tool running on Windosws OS for remote controlling temperature chamber which produced by “重庆银河试验”.

This GUI could connect with chamber/read current running status/read current temperature/set target temperature.

Most importantly, this GUI could set a wave on plot and make chamber's temperature follow the wave.

This tool only works with chamber produced by “重庆银河试验仪器有限公司”, and the software communication protocol may change, which could cause the function to fail. 

Therefore, it is necessary to confirm before using it.
